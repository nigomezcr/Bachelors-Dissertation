# Important Concepts

##Neutron Stars

To understan what a NS is, we first need to understand the following concepts:

* *Electron degeneracy pressure*: Is a type of quantum degeneracy pressure that occurs thanks to Pauli exclusion principle. As fermions
cannot occupy the same quantum state within a quantum system, there is a "repulsive force" that separates them. This repulsive pressure 
is the degeneracy pressure. 
* *Chandrasekhar limit*: In stars there must be a balance between gravitational atraction and some kind of preasure. This can be electron
degeneracy pressure (in the case of white dwarfs). Chandrasekhar limit is the mass limit above which the EDP cannot avoid a gravitational
collapse.
* *Main sequence star*: Is the most common kind of star with ceratain relation between stellar color vs brightness.
* *Neutron star*: It is formed after a star (out of the main sequence) has consumed all its fuel, the balance against gravity being 
therefore only sustained by degeneracy pressure, and when burning extra mass in the shell, thus exceeding Chandrasekhar limit, it is
forced to collapse. This collapsed remnant is the Neutron Star.
